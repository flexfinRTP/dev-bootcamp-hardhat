# Chainlink Bootcamp Project

My first Solidity project completed during the Chainlink Virtual Bootcamp, July 2021.

Tasks included interacting with Chainlink Oracles, developing smart contracts, compiling and deploying on Remix and Ethereum Kovan Testnet.

See some examples of the kovan contract interactions [Here](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0x7c43370367fa81d4fe9ce6161fe60afffe7c8baa).
